Connecting the Front-end and Back-end
mandatory
To start this task, make a copy of your task2 directory and name it task3.

This task will have you connect your front-end to the back-end allowing you to have dynamic data on your front-end. This means that communication will occur between your two Docker images (each of which will be running in their own Docker container). To facilitate this, be sure to have multiple terminal instances open so you can have one Docker container running on each.
